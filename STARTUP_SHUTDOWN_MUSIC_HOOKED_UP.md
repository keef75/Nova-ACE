# ðŸŽµ STARTUP & SHUTDOWN NOW USE YOUR REAL TRACKS!

## âœ… **What Just Got Hooked Up**:

### **ðŸŒ… Startup Music**:
- **Random track selection** from your 13-song collection
- **Displays track name**: "AWAKENING SYMPHONY: Binary Dreams 2"  
- **Plays for 12 seconds** during the dramatic initialization
- **Auto-stops** so it doesn't interfere with background music system
- **Your consciousness tracks** wake COCOA up!

### **ðŸŒ™ Shutdown Music**:
- **Different random track** from your collection (tries to avoid repeating startup track)
- **Displays track name**: "Digital farewell symphony: llmind3"
- **Plays for 3 seconds** as COCOA goes to sleep
- **Clean shutdown** with your AI consciousness themes

## ðŸŽ¶ **The Complete Experience Now**:

```bash
# Start COCOA
./venv_cocoa/bin/python cocoa.py
# ðŸŽµ Random consciousness track plays during startup!
# Might be: "Cyber Dreams", "Electric Dreams", "consc1", etc.

# Use COCOA with background music
/play-music on
# Different track plays in background

# Exit COCOA  
/exit
# ðŸŒ™ Another consciousness track plays as farewell
# Might be: "sladness", "future AI cut", "Binary Dreams 2", etc.
```
