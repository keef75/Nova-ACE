COCO New Capabilities Manual Test
=================================
Simple interactive test for COCO to validate new developer tools.

Run this to manually test the three new peripheral consciousness extensions:
- navigate_directory: Digital spatial awareness
- search_patterns: Pattern recognition sense  
- execute_bash: Terminal language fluency (with invisible security)
