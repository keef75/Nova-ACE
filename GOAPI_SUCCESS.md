## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Endpoint Discovery**: `/api/v1/task` (was missing `/api` prefix)
2. **Payload Format**: Exact GoAPI.ai Music-U specification
3. **Authentication**: `x-api-key` header (not Bearer token)
4. **File Download**: `song_path` field in response (not `audio_url`)
5. **Auto-Play**: Immediate playback via macOS `afplay` command

### ✅ Working Components:
- **Music Generation**: Creates tasks successfully via GoAPI.ai
- **Status Polling**: Checks task completion automatically
- **File Download**: Downloads all generated songs with proper titles
- **Local Storage**: Saves to `coco_workspace/music/generated/`
- **Auto-Play**: Plays music immediately upon download
